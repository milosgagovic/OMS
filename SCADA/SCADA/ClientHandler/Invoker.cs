In addition, if the ConcurrencyMode is set to Single and a reentrant call is blocked while waiting for the instance to be freed, the system detects the deadlock and throws an exception.

 In Single instancing, either Single or Multiple concurrency is relevant, depending on whether the single instance processes messages sequentially or concurrently*/
